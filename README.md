# Face-recognition-in-python-
This project is carried out in python (Pycharm).
In this project I have used OpenCV(to capture image from atteched web cam), Face recognition ( to recognise image in real time), Tkinter(for GUI) and  MySql ( for database connectivity)  and some other library and modules.
The main purpose of this project is to identify the employees and maintain record of their incoming and outgoing activity or moniter. 
This project also provide authentication for Admin login as it authenticate admin using real time face image.
